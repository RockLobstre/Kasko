A glimpse into the astonishing future of BaaS- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) with a simple To do list app.

## Presentation
Since its interesting evolution from the [Google I/O 2016](https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/05/firebase-expands-to-become-unified-app.html), my goal was to play with Firebase to witness the potential as well as the limitations.

This project is nothing more than a way to play with what I've learn. I was also curious to see how it fits with the tools I usually use such as Dagger and RxJava.
